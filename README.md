# Introduction

Project RC is a project to make a driveable RC car using BLE and Arduino hardware to take controls from a mobile device.

## Features

What this does is leverage the Bluetooth of the Arduino ESP32 to become a BLE server that a mobile device can connect to and control it with inputs from that device.

## Technologies

Arduino Nano ESP32
TB6612FNG Motor Driver
Arduino IDE

## Installation

All you will need to do is upload the code to your ESP32 device and connect to it from the app that will go with this.

## Development Setup

What a new developer wil need to know to get set up and create/compile an inital build from the repo is having the Arduino IDE installed with ESP32 libraries installed.
